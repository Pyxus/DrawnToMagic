### Glyph Recognizer v1
This is the first iteration of the glyph recognition system. I caught it working and managed to record it, but it is often times confused.

## New ideas

### Chronological Task Focus for a Playable Demo

- Define the game world and setting.
- Develop a balanced spell system with basic glyphs and their effects.
- Design the tutorial system to teach players the core mechanics.
- Implement basic environmental interactions for a more immersive experience.
- Create a few simple puzzles and obstacles.

### Glyph Fusion

- players can merge glyphs to create new spells with combined effects.
- fusing a fire glyph with a wind glyph might create a firestorm effect spell. 
- to balance this feature, make fusion a unique or costly process
    - require specific items or resources
    - limit the number of fused glyphs a player can use at any given time
    - make the time to cast a fused glyph longer
    - make the mana cost higher
    - reward the player for drawing the whole complicated fused glyph by increasing its power or reducing the mana cost for the skill required to cast the spell from memory

### Environmental Interactions

- design glyphs that have dynamic interactions with the game world to add strategic depth.
- a water manipulation glyph could:
    - extinguish fires
    - create temporary bridges
    - solve puzzles
- design environmental challenges that necessitate clever usage of these interactive glyphs for progression.

### Time-limited Glyphs

- introduce potent yet temporary glyphs acquired through:
    - quests
    - events
    - rare drops
- these glyphs could grant exceptional abilities, such as:
    - invincibility
    - massive damage output
- limit their duration or usage to maintain balance and add excitement to gameplay.

### Cooperative Spellcasting

- in a multiplayer environment, enable players to collaboratively create more powerful spells.
- players can combine glyphs, like ice and lightning, to produce a potent ice-lightning combo.
- design challenges and boss fights that encourage cooperation through coordinated spellcasting.

### Glyph Evolution

- as players progress or level up, allow their glyphs to evolve, increasing their potency or gaining new abilities.
- introduce a separate progression system based on:
    - glyph usage
    - specific items
    - allow players to guide their glyphs' development through choices

### Spellcasting Challenges

- incorporate challenges that test players' glyph-drawing skills, including:
    - time-limited challenges
    - precision tests
    - puzzles requiring specific glyph combinations
- reward successful players with:
    - new glyphs
    - resources
    - unique items

### Glyph Mastery

- implement a mastery system where players can enhance their proficiency with specific glyphs, resulting in:
    - reduced casting time
    - increased power
    - additional effects
    - mastery can be achieved through:
    - repeated usage
    - completing glyph-related challenges

### Elemental Affinities

- integrate an elemental affinity system where players, enemies, and environments possess strengths and weaknesses tied to certain elements.
- encourage strategic glyph usage for engaging encounters.

### Hidden Glyphs

- conceal secret glyphs throughout the game world to reward exploration and curiosity.
- these glyphs can have:
    - unique effects
    - access to hidden areas and content

### Glyph Customization

- enable players to personalize glyphs with cosmetic enhancements, such as:
    - unique visual effects
    - colors
    - animations
    - foster a sense of ownership and pride in players' spellcasting abilities

### Inspirations for Glyphs

- Chinese Characters
- Japanese Kanji
- Hieroglyphics
- Runes
- Alchemical Symbols
